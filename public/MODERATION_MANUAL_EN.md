## Moderation Principles

### Fairness and Impartiality

  - Apply same standards to all users regardless of influence, follower count, or contributions
  - Do not let personal preferences affect moderation decisions

  - Make decisions based on objective evidence only
  - Presumption of innocence - when uncertain, favor content retention

### Consistency

  - Refer to handling of similar past cases
  - Maintain stable moderation standards

  - Consult other moderators on complex or controversial cases
  - Regular team meetings to unify standards

### Transparency

  - When removing content or banning accounts, provide clear reasons
  - Cite specific violated community guideline clauses

  - Document reasons for each decision in moderation system
  - Facilitate appeal handling and quality review

### Respect

  - Maintain professionalism and politeness even when handling violations
  - Do not use insulting language

  - Do not publicly discuss specific user moderation cases
  - Share sensitive information only within internal systems

### Proportionality

  - Penalties should match violation severity
  - First minor violation: warning > temporary restriction > ban

---

- Serious violations still handled according to standards

- **No lowered standards** - same rules apply

## Appeal Handling

### Appeal Review Process

- User submits appeal via `/appeal` page
- System automatically creates appeal ticket

- Check if appeal is complete (includes appeal reasons, evidence)
- Review original moderation decision and evidence

- Assign to moderator other than original reviewer
- Re-examine case, consider appellant's explanation
- Consult team (complex cases)

- **Uphold**: Original decision correct, appeal rejected
- **Overturn**: Original decision incorrect, restore content/account
- **Reduce**: Original decision too harsh, reduce penalty (e.g., 30 days to 7 days)

- Send detailed result notification to appellant
- If overturned, immediately restore content/account features

### Appeal Success Rate Target

- **Target**: 20-30% of appeals partially or fully supported
- If success rate < 10%, may indicate overly strict moderation standards
- If success rate > 50%, may indicate low initial review quality

---

## Self-Care

### Mental Health


- Take 10-15 minute breaks every hour of moderation
- Avoid continuous moderation for more than 4 hours

- If you see disturbing content, you can:
  - Talk to supervisor or other moderators
  - Use company-provided counseling services
  - Request break or switch moderation categories

- Outside work hours, don't handle urgent appeals (unless on duty)
- Don't bring work stress home

### Report Serious Content

5. Do not download or save content
6. Immediately mark as "serious violation" in system
7. Notify Community Manager and legal team
8. Fill out "Serious Violation Report Form" including:
   - Content URL and user ID
   - Violation type and severity
   - Discovery time
   - Whether law enforcement has been notified
