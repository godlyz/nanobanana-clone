    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faq1": {
      "question": "What are credits and how are they used?",
      "answer": "Text-to-image uses 1 credit, image-to-image uses 2 credits. Credits are automatically recharged at the start of each billing cycle - monthly plans recharge monthly, annual plans receive the full year's allocation upfront (1 USD = 10 credits)."
    },
    "faq2": {
      "question": "Can I change my plan anytime?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your plan at any time. Upgrades take effect immediately, while downgrades will take effect in the next billing cycle."
    },
    "faq3": {
      "question": "Do unused credits roll over?",
      "answer": "Monthly plan credits do not roll over to the next month. Annual plan credits are valid for the entire subscription period. We recommend choosing a plan based on your actual usage needs."
    },
    "faq4": {
      "question": "What payment methods are supported?",
      "answer": "We support credit cards, debit cards, Alipay, WeChat Pay, and other payment methods. All payments are processed through secure third-party payment platforms."
    },
    "faq5": {
      "question": "How many credits does video generation consume?",
      "answer": "Video generation consumes credits based on duration: 4-second videos consume 40 credits, 6-second videos consume 60 credits, and 8-second videos consume 80 credits. All plans support video generation and offer multiple resolution options (720p/1080p)."
